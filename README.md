## Project summary

### The issue we are hoping to solve

REPLACE THIS SENTENCE with a short description, 2-3 sentences in length, of the specific sustainability problem your solution is meant to address.

### How our technology solution can help

REPLACE THIS SENTENCE with a short description of your team's solution, in about 10 words.

### Our idea

INSTRUCTIONS: Replace this paragraph with a longer description of your solution. In about 500 words, describe your solution in more detail. Include the real-world problem you identified, describe the technological solution you have created, and explain how itâ€™s an improvement over existing solutions. You can supply additional documentation in this source code repository that you link to as well.

More detail is available in our [description document](./docs/DESCRIPTION.md).

## Technology implementation

### IBM AI service(s) used

_INSTRUCTIONS: Included here is a list of commonly used IBM AI services. Remove any services you did not use, or add others from the linked catalog not already listed here. Leave only those included in your solution code. Provide details on where and how you used each IBM AI service to help judges review your implementation. Remove these instructions._

- [IBM Natural Language Understanding](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/natural-language-understanding) - WHERE AND HOW THIS IS USED IN OUR SOLUTION
- [Watson Assistant](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-assistant) - WHERE AND HOW THIS IS USED IN OUR SOLUTION
- [Watson Discovery](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-discovery) - WHERE AND HOW THIS IS USED IN OUR SOLUTION
- [Watson Speech to Text](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/speech-to-text) - WHERE AND HOW THIS IS USED IN OUR SOLUTION
- [Watson Text to Speech](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/text-to-speech) - WHERE AND HOW THIS IS USED IN OUR SOLUTION
- List any additional [IBM AI services](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog?category=ai#services) used or remove this line

### Other IBM technology used

INSTRUCTIONS: List any other IBM technology used in your solution and describe how each component was used. If you can provide links to/details on exactly where these were used in your code, that would help the judges review your submission.

### Solution architecture

Diagram and step-by-step description of the flow of our solution:

![Video transcription/translaftion app](https://developer.ibm.com/developer/tutorials/cfc-starter-kit-speech-to-text-app-example/images/cfc-covid19-remote-education-diagram-2.png)

1. The user navigates to the site and uploads a video file.
2. Watson Speech to Text processes the audio and extracts the text.
3. Watson Translation (optionally) can translate the text to the desired language.
4. The app stores the translated text as a document within Object Storage.

## Presentation materials

_INSTRUCTIONS: The following deliverables should be officially posted to your My Team > Submissions section of the [Call for Code Global Challenge resources site](https://cfc-prod.skillsnetwork.site/), but you can also include them here for completeness. Replace the examples seen here with your own deliverable links._
